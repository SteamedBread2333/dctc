# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to keep the latest released version secure. Please upgrade to the newest version whenever possible.

- **Supported**: latest version on npm / latest release on GitHub
- **Not supported**: older versions (unless explicitly stated in a release note)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of the following private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)**  
   - Go to the repository page → **Security** → **Advisories** → **New draft security advisory**.
2. **Email**  
   - If Security Advisories are not available, email the maintainer(s) at: **TODO: add security contact email**

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
- Affected versions / environment details
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

## Our Response Process

We try to follow this process:

- **Acknowledgement**: within **7 days**
- **Triage & validation**: as soon as possible (priority based on severity)
- **Fix & release**: we will publish a patched version when ready
- **Credit**: we will credit reporters in the release notes/advisory if desired

## Coordinated Disclosure

We ask that you keep the report private until a fix is released, or we agree on a disclosure timeline.

## Supply Chain / Package Integrity

If you suspect a compromised release (e.g., npm package tampering), please report immediately and include:

- Package name/version
- Install command/output (if safe to share)
- Hashes/signatures (if available)
